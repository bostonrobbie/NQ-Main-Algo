# Strategy Optimization Request
I need help optimizing my trading strategy 'NQORB' on NQ=F.
Current Backtest Performance:
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.00
- Total Return: 0.00%
- Max Drawdown: 0.00%
- Profit Factor: 0.00

## Performance Issues:
- The risk-adjusted return (Sharpe) is critically low.
- The strategy has low expectancy (Profit Factor near 1.0).

## Task:
Please suggest filtering criteria or indicator modifications to improve this strategy.
Focus specifically on how to avoid the losing trades identified above in their respective market regimes.
Should I add a Volatility filter, change the Lookback period, or implement a dynamic Exit?
